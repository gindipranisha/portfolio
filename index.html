              <h1>This section is all about me</h1>
              <hr>
              <p>Hi, I am Pranisha. I am a web designer and a mean stack developer from India who loves creating things. Everything around me inspires in some or other way and that keeps me motivated and driven.</p><p>The quality that attracts me in person is the optimistic nature and absolutely can't stand the negativity. I always have this child-like imagination no matter how old I grow.</p>
              <p>I love dancing and it makes me feel alive. I am a fitness fanatic. I play badminton and not a sportsperson though but have always been into them. I dislike having conversations about people rather ideas for the betterment and improvement. The only feeling I always carry with myself is "feeling blessed" no matter how tough situations are.</p>
             <p>I always wanted to do something that gives me the satisfaction at the end of the day. I wasn't a technology person from childhood, being a 90's kid. I always wanted to work according to my own rules and deep inside my heart, I ended up dreaming about becoming an entreprenuer. Well it grew bigger than I expected.   </p>
             <p>And the field I chose,though I am a beginner, I will make sure that I will put my best efforts into this instead of complaining. </p>
